# 📅 React Day 1 – Getting Started with React 🚀

Today, I began my journey into React – a powerful JavaScript library for building modern, fast, and interactive UIs.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:

### ✅ What is React?
- A JavaScript library developed by Facebook.
- Used to build component-based, reusable UI.
- Follows a declarative approach.

### ✅ Why React?
- Component-based structure = reusable code.
- Faster UI rendering via Virtual DOM.
- Easy to integrate with other libraries.
- Strong ecosystem (hooks, router, redux, etc.).

---

### ✅ Project Setup using Vite (Faster than CRA)

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-day1-app --template react
cd react-day1-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
## ✅ File Structure Highlights
```
📁 src
 ┣ 📄 main.jsx     → Entry point
 ┗ 📁 App.jsx      → Root component
```
## ✅ React Basics Syntax
```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React 🚀</h1>
      <p>This is my first React component!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
## package.json vs package-lock.json
| `package.json`     | `package-lock.json`               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Lists dependencies | Exact versions + dependency tree  |
| Editable manually  | Auto-generated by npm             |
| Used by developers | Used by npm to install accurately |
## ✅ Difference: HTML vs XML vs XAML
| HTML           | XML         | XAML         |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Web markup     | Data format | UI for .NET  |
| Not strict     | Strict      | Declarative  |
| Not extensible | Extensible  | Based on XML |
