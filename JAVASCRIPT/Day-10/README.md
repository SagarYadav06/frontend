# ðŸš€ JavaScript Day 10: Polyfills

# ðŸ“š What is a Polyfill?
ðŸ‘‰ Polyfill means recreating the functionality of built-in JavaScript methods when browser support is missing or for better core understanding.

ðŸ‘‰ It helps us understand how these methods actually work behind the scenes.


This folder contains custom polyfills (manual implementations) for:
- âœ… map
- âœ… filter
- âœ… reduce
- âœ… bind

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned:
- What is a polyfill and why it's important.
- How to build my own versions of core JavaScript methods.
- Deep understanding of how map, filter, reduce, and bind actually work internally.

---

## ðŸ’» Files:
- `polyfill-map.js`
- `polyfill-filter.js`
- `polyfill-reduce.js`
- `polyfill-bind.js`

## ðŸ”¥ My Note:
Writing polyfills gave me a strong grip on core JavaScript array methods and function binding. This was a next-level learning experience!

*I will continue updating this repository with my daily learning progress. Stay tuned! ðŸš€*
