# ðŸš€ JavaScript Day 11: Debounce, Throttle, and Currying

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned Today:

### âœ… Debounce
- Used to delay execution until user stops triggering events.
- Commonly used in search inputs.

### âœ… Throttle
- Used to limit how often a function can be called.
- Useful in scroll or resize events.

### âœ… Currying
- Breaking down a function into smaller functions that take one argument at a time.

---

## ðŸ’» Code Included:
- debounce.js
- throttle.js
- currying.js

---

## ðŸ”¥ My Note:
Today I worked on performance and functional patterns.  
I finally understood the difference between Debounce vs Throttle and practiced Currying to write clean and reusable logic.

*Stay tuned for more advanced topics!* ðŸš€
