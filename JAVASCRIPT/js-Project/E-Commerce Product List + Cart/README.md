## 🧠 Logic Flow

### 🔹 1. Load Products
- Products stored in an array
- Loop and render as cards in `#product-list`

### 🔹 2. Add to Cart
- If product exists → increment quantity
- Else → add new product to cart array

### 🔹 3. Render Cart
- Display items with name × qty and total
- Update total price dynamically
